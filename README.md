# PUSH_SWAP
Making a sorting program. The program takes a set of integer values as an input. 2 stacks are allowed to use for the sorting.

## Must Know
* ***Stack*** : A Stack is an **abstract data type** that serves as a collection of of elements with two main operations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push, which adds an element to the collection, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop, which removes the most recently added element.

<br/>

* ***Abstract data type*** : contrast to data structure. How the data is implemented is not defined.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a stack has push/pop operations that follow a Last-In-First-Out rule, and can be concretely implemented using either a list or an array (**the list or the array is data structure in this case**).[^1]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.

## Key Point
* It was difficult for me to figure out how to start to build sorting algorithm! Just start with sorting 2 or 3 integers.
* many different algorithms have been invented by smart people. I chose a proper one (radix sort) and tried to implement with my code.
